      At MyoMod, we believe that the way you control your prosthesis is one of the most important factors in determining whether it truly supports you in daily life—or ends up not being used at all. That’s why we’re initially focusing on developing the intuitive control algorithm for our prosthes. To support this, we’ve built an armband equipped with the same EMG sensors that will later be used in the prosthesis. This allows us to test and refine the algorithms in a virtual environment and collect high-quality training data efficiently.

      Building intuitive prosthetics takes data, lots of it. That’s why the student team MouseWorks from HNU created Float, a VR game where you help the Pookis restore their shattered floating kingdom. Every move you make while wearing our MyoMod Bracelet generates valuable data, bringing us closer to prostheses that are truly intuitive for everyone.

    title: Our Mission
    text: > 
      We are a startup in our founding phase developing prosthetic solutions. It is our belief that myoelectric control and its associated benefits, should be widely available. We thereby focus on regions without proper health insurance and care infrastructure.
      Therefore our Designs have to be extremely robust, very affordable and easy to repair. 

      Being modular by design, MyoMod can be quickly adapted to different pathologies.
